    "Shopee is a fast-growing e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. In order to build an enjoyable online shopping experience, Shopee's product managers would first need to identify customer sentiment and understand users' pain points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the data science team has been tasked to classify the positive and negative reviews on Shopee Singapore's Google Play using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model that achieves the highest accuracy and recall on the validation set will be selected for production. The team will be using topic modeling to identify the key pain points among dissatisfied customers. This will enable product managers to address their immediate needs."

    "The data science team web scraped 4,461 unique user reviews on Shopee's Google Play. Classical machine learning and deep learning NLP approaches were explored when building a sentiment classification model for Shopee reviews. The Voting Classifier was eventually selected as our production model as it achieved the highest accuracy and recall on the validation set. An ensemble of a TF-IDF Logistic Regression and a TF-IDF SVC, the Voting Classifier attained an accuracy of 0.904 and a recall of 0.87 on the validation data. When scored on the test set, the production model achieved 0.892 on accuracy and 0.87 on recall, outperforming the baseline accuracy of 0.61. We can thus conclude that the model generalises well on unseen data. This model serves as a good start for Shopee's product managers to classify sentiments and understand customers' pain points through Google Play reviews. The model was deployed to [Heroku](https://shopee-sentiment-analysis.herokuapp.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team has also identified 3 pain points among dissatisfied customers through topic modeling. These pain points include a poor payment experience, fraudulent sellers and items, and slow app performance. Addressing these pain points would not only promote an enjoyable shopping experience for customers, but would also differentiate Shopee from its competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers are most frustrated when they run into payment issues during checkout. The payment was either denied or the payment page simply took too long to load. Product managers will need to work closely with software engineers to enhance the stability and reliability of its payment gateway service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several customers have dealt with fraudulent sellers on Shopee. Identifying and blocking fraudulent sellers at the early stages is the key to fraud prevention. This involves tracking a range of behavioural pattern among sellers and combing through their digital identity for any signs of suspicious behaviour. Shopee could also improve its buyers' protection scheme to regain consumers’ trust. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users have reported that the app hangs or crashes at the login and payment page. As such, developers will need to optimise its traffic scheduling platform's latency to accommodate high traffic during big sale events."

On the other hand, 'load', 'worst' and 'scam' are most closely associated to negative sentiment. 'Load' probably relates to the app taking a long time to load while 'scam' may indicate that several customers have encountered seller scams on Shopee. As the occurence of the word 'load' increases by 1, the likelihood of the review being negative, increases by more than 14 times."

However, they should have a more stringent process of allowing China sellers to be on the platform. I have encountered many issues with China sellers, either received faulty item or send wrong item. Some are sincere in resolving but some are not., resulting a waste of money. Perhaps there should be a quality check on these sellers?   \n",

       "1038  I am a frequent user of this apps. Shopee needs to have a strict rules and requirements apply to sellers as to have a smooth transaction for buyers. 1) Seller shouldn't list items that is not in stock and at the end of the day we need to go through the refund process. 2) Encountered many times that seller requested to cancel order as they update the price wrongly. 3) Seller is not being honest to inform if there is no stock partially but still proceed with shipment for the rest of the items.   \n",

       "1331                                                Shopee is a biased platform whom sides sellers more than buyers. These words came from Shopee CSR themselves that Sellers are able to delete ratings from buyers without consent from buyers. Hence, it is impossible to know if sellers on the platform are reputable or not even based on the ratings as dishonest sellers are able to remove the 'bad' ratings from buyers, to 'look good'. Not recommending this unfair platform to any others!   \n",

Usually for clothings , i prefer brick and motar , see whether it fits . As long as physical products , i would gladly purchase , best can include warranty . I will go only for the quality . This app is very handy . I know where to save money when purchasing . It has some really good stuffs . I will keep coming back , a very good place for bargains .   \n",

These words came from Shopee CSR themselves that Sellers are able to delete ratings from buyers without consent from buyers.

Kind of silly to have to wait a full 24hrs in order to optimise the use of 1,000 shopee coins. 2. Wish all fake goods sellers (eg. Micro SD cards..) can be removed or blocked so as not to waste buyer's effort to purchase only to realise they are fakes. But overall, still pleased with the online shopping experience.

       "841                     ,i think it is better to inform a time slot when the delivery man is coming to deliver parcel to door stop and the timing of the delivery is not being mentioned .Besides this ,Shopee parcels dosent always come on time unlike Ezbuy .There is always issues with the parcels ,some parcels take over one month to come.In terms of shipping ,Ezbuy does it better. The parcel that took one month to come is ridiculous ,i always feel that buying on Shopee takes more risk than on Ezbuy.   \n",

    "**Poor payment experience** \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers are most frustrated when they run into payment issues during checkout. The payment was either denied or the payment page simply took too long to load. Although customers are given the option of paying via bank transfers, the process is not entirely seamless. Some were not able to upload the receipt for verification due to a platform error. A handful of customers have also mentioned in their Google Play reviews that they were not able to apply their voucher or discount codes at the point of checkout. We can imagine the disappointment that customers face when they were not able to enjoy the promotional prices that were promised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers today demand a fast, convenient and secure payment experience. As such, the software engineers at Shopee will need to look into enhancing the stability and reliability of its payment gateway service. Given that card payments are processed through third-party providers, engineers will need to figure out if these payment issues are surfacing from the third-party providers' end, or as a result of Shopee's internal systems. Reducing friction in the payment process will definitely help to reduce cart abandonment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fraudulent sellers and items**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several customers have reported fraudulent seller behaviour. These scams include not having received the items ordered, or receiving counterfeit, defective products. When these issues were raised to Shopee's customer service, the problem was either not resolved in a timely fashion, or customers did not receive their refunds. This has thus disappointed and angered many affected customers and several feel that Shopee favours the sellers over the buyers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a robust model that identifies and blocks fraudulent sellers at the early stages will help to prevent seller fraud and preserve buyers' trust. This involves tracking a range of behavioural pattern among sellers and combing through their digital identity for any signs of suspicious behaviour. While the team continues to build better fraud detection algorithms, it will not be possible to completely stamp out frauds. Shopee could improve its buyers' protection scheme to boost buyers' confidence. Given Shopee's escrow service, in the event when the order is not delivered or the items do not match the seller's description, Shopee should reimburse the full cost to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slow app performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users have reported that the app hangs or crashes at the login and payment page. This is an issue of latency, meaning that there is a delay between an action and a response. Several other reviews have also mentioned that the app's functionalities had slowed down considerably after updating the app. Some were reportedly not able to load Shopee's games after updating the app, and were thus upset that they could not collect Shopee coins. These coins can be used to offset the cost of the next purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers will need to optimise Shopee's traffic scheduling platform's throughput and latency. Ensuring smooth running of the platform is crucial especially during big sale events where the server runs the risk of being overloaded due to high traffic. Developers will also need to stress test before releasing new app updates to ensure that the app's performance is not compromised."

    "The production model is a Voting Classifier consisting of an ensemble of a Logistic Regression and SVC. Given its relatively high accuracy (0.892) and recall (0.87) on the test set, we can conclude that the model generalises well on unseen data. This model serves as a good start for Shopee's product managers to classify sentiments and understand customers' pain points through Google Play reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team has also identified 3 pain points among dissatisfied customers through topic modeling. Product managers will need to work closely with software engineers and developers to build a seamless payments experience, crack down on fraudulent sellers and improve app performance in terms of latency.\n",
    " \n",
    "Despite the model's relatively high performance, there is still room for improvement. Misclassifications tend to occur when users leave mixed reviews on Shopee. For instance, when the user praises Shopee for being 'good' in one aspect, but indicates that there are other areas of improvement, the model classifies this is a positive review. Sentiments are inherently subjective. However, given that the user is dissatisfied with certain aspects of the shopping experience, it is worth classifying such reviews as negative sentiments. This will allow product managers to be informed of these pain points. In order to reduce misclassifications, we can train the model on reviews from the Apple App Store too. Given that we have also identified customers' pain points, the next step would be to use these topics as features in our sentiment classification model. This may help to improve the model's accuracy and recall."
